# BitArray Library

The **BitArray** library is a C++ implementation of a dynamic array of bits, providing various bitwise operations, resizing, and other utilities for managing and manipulating bits efficiently.

This project demonstrates how to implement a memory-efficient, low-level data structure for managing bits in C++. It serves as a practical exercise in custom container design, bitwise operations, and performance-oriented programming.


## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Running

To build and execute the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TimSkripnikov/BitArray-Library.git
   cd BitArray-Library
   ```

2. **Generate build files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```

4. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   ./build/tests/BitArrayTest
   ```



## üöÄ Running Tests

The project includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the `BitArray` class. The tests are compiled and executed as part of the build process using the command in step 4 above. Upon execution, you will see the results of the test cases in the terminal.
